        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Like most of us, I was born. Some years later when I studied in STI College Lipa I created my first website.
            It was fun and exciting.  I graduated with an award of Best Thesis for our Online Inquiry and Reservation with billing System.
            It is a website that aims to improve the current system of a catering service.
