aboutmeContent = Like most of us, I was born. Some years later when I studied in STI College Lipa I created my first website.  It was fun and exciting.  I graduated with an award of Best Thesis for our Online Inquiry and Reservation with billing System.  It is a website that aims to improve the current system of a catering service.<br /><br />My first job was exciting, because I've learned a lot.  On the 18th of May, 2014, I was hired in PUSOD, Inc. Actually I was an intern to their company and they hired me because they like the website that I've developed for them.<br>After I finished the project in PUSOD, I applied at Kinpo Electronics, Phils. as Software Engineer.  On 10th of August, 2015, I became a member of the Web team, we are in-charge of the websites of the company.  We are maintaining the contents and creating website projects.
